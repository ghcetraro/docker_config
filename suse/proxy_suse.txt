SUSE Linux Enterprise : How to setup a Proxy manually

Environment
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 
Situation
Setting up a proxy through YaST may not be preferred in some environments, so a manual method may be used.
Resolution
Each account will need either its own proxy environment variables or a global proxy can be setup. 
If the environment requires a 'per-user' setup, then the proxy configuration will need to be achieved by creating a .bashrc file in the home folder to accommodate setting for the following environment variables. 
Otherwise 'system-wide' variables can be configured by editing the global /etc/sysconfig/proxy file
Global proxy configuration
The global configuration file should look like the example below (please adjust TCP/IP addresses and Port numbers to match the environment)

Please edit /etc/sysconfig/proxy with the following proxy values

PROXY_ENABLED="yes"
HTTP_PROXY="http://192.168.0.1:3128"
HTTPS_PROXY="http://192.168.0.1:3128"
FTP_PROXY="http://192.168.0.1:3128"
NO_PROXY="localhost, 127.0.0.1"
Single user proxy configuration
When it is desired or required to set a proxy configuration for a single user, please create a .bashrc file under the users home directory, and add the following export commands :

export http_proxy="http://192.168.0.1"
export ftp_proxy="http://192.168.0.1"
export https_proxy="http://192.168.0.1"
export no_proxy="localhost, 127.0.0.1"

Providing credentials to the proxy
If the proxy requires credentials to login you will need to create the following file:
/root/.curlrc
Let us assume the user is named 'john, then the following will need to be created 
/home/john/.curlrc
The following permissions need to be set to his file :
-rw-r--r-- 1 user:group 16:18 .curlrc
The file should also follow the format below where john is the user and n0v3ll is the password :

# Created proxy file on 09/14/2010
proxy-user = "john:n0v3ll"
Note: For the setting to take effect immediately you will need to either log out and back in or export the proxy variables via the terminal session.
Additional Information
Applications that support it, such as YaST2 Online Update, use them immediately. Other applications use them after a new login (lynx, wget). 
Some applications do not support these settings at all â€“ they use their own settings system.
