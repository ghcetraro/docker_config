You can add these options to the docker daemon as the default for all the containers it runs. 
On the dockerd command line, the options are the same, --dns XX.XX.1.1 --dns-search companydomain. 
To avoid changing the startup scripts to add that option, it's easier to setup an 

/etc/docker/daemon.json 

file with the following contents:

{
  "dns": ["XX.XX.1.1"],
  "dns-search": ["companydomain"]
}

Then restart the docker daemon with systemctl restart docker to apply the change.

You may find it better to update the 

/etc/resolv.conf 

in your VM to apply this change to not on the docker containers, but the VM itself. That would look like:

nameserver XX.XX.1.1
search companydomain

If updating the resolv.conf, be sure that it's not managed by another tool, e.g. 
if you are getting dhcp addresses for your VM this would be overwritten by the dhcp client daemon.
